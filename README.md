# Ryans-Portfolio

## Description

With this project, I created a portfolio webpage for myself including an "about me", a recent photo, and some image links to past projects, in order for potential employers to view myself and my work and vet whether I'd be a good fit for their company. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The page's navbar can be utilized to scroll to any of the three sections of my portfolio. In the "work" section, one can click any image link (as long as they aren't labeled coming soon) and be taken to the deployed page for that respective project. Via the footer links, one can call me, email me, or go to my Github account page, respectively.

The portfolio can be accessed at [here.](https://rdalby2002.github.io/Ryans-Portfolio/)
